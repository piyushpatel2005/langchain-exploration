    "## LangGraph Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph was designed to enable developers to implement multiactor, multistep, stateful cognitive architectures called graphs. \n",
    "Multiple LLMs or even in combination with web search, we can build complex systems. An application with multiple actors need a coordiantion layer to do these things.\n",
    "- Define the actors involved and how they hand off work to each other (edges of that graph).\n",
    "- Schedule execution of each actor at an appropriate time - in parallel if needed - with deterministic results.\n",
    "\n",
    "When each actor hand off to another, you need to understand back-and-forth between multiple actors. You need to know what order it happens in, how many times each actor is called, etc. Communication across steps require tracking state otherwise when you call the LLM actor the second time, you will get the same result as the first time. It's helpful to pull this state out of each actors and have all actors collaborate on updating a single central state. With single state, you can \n",
    "- snapshot and store the central state during or after each computation\n",
    "- pause and resume execution, which makes it easy to recover from errors.\n",
    "- implement human-in-the-loop controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Each graph is made up of below components.\n",
    "- State: The data received from outside the application, modified and produced by the application while it's running\n",
    "- Nodes: Each step is called a node. Nodes are Python functions which receive the current state as input and can return an updte to that state\n",
    "- Edges: The connection between nodes. Edges determine the path taken from the first node to the last or they can be fixed or conditional.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph offers utilities to visualize these graphs and numerous features to debug their workings while developing them. These graphs can then be deployed to serve production workloads at scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can add LangGraph using `uv` with below command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "uv add langgraph\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create StateGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create `StateGraph`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For defining graph, first define the state of the graph. The state consists of the shape, schema of the graph state and a reducer functions which specify how to update the state. In this case, the state is a dictionary with single key `messages`. The `messages` key is annotated with `add_messages` reducer function. This function tells LangGraph to append new messages to the existing list.\n",
    "\n",
    "State keys without an annotation will be overwritten by each update, storing the most recent value. You can also use your own reducer which receive two arguments:\n",
    "1. current state\n",
    "2. The next value being written to the state\n",
    "and it returns the next state which is the result of merging the current state with the new value.\n"

       " 'sql_explanation': \"\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\nLet's break down this SQL query step-by-step:\\n\\n1. **`SELECT product_id, SUM(price * quantity) AS total_sales`**:\\n   - `product_id`:  This selects the unique identifier for each product. We want to see the total sales *for each* product.\\n   - `SUM(price * quantity)`: This is the core of the calculation.  It multiplies the `price` (the price of one unit of the product) by the `quantity` (the number of units sold in an order) for each row in the `order_items` table. The `SUM()` function then adds up all those individual product sales amounts.\\n   - `AS total_sales`: This gives a more descriptive name to the calculated column.  Instead of just seeing `SUM(price * quantity)`, the column will be labeled `total_sales` in the results.\\n\\n2. **`FROM order_items`**:\\n   - This specifies that we're pulling data from the `order_items` table. This table is assumed to contain information about each item in an order, including the `product_id`, `price`, and `quantity`.\\n\\n3. **`GROUP BY product_id`**:\\n   - This is the crucial part that makes the query work correctly. The `GROUP BY` clause tells the database to group all rows with the *same* `product_id` together.\\n   - The `SUM()` function then operates *within each group*.  So, it calculates the total sales for *all* orders containing that specific `product_id`.\\n\\n**In simpler terms:**\\n\\nThe query goes through the `order_items` table, figures out the sales amount for each item (price * quantity), and then adds up all the sales amounts for each individual product.  The result is a table showing each product and its total sales.\\n\\n**Assumptions:**\\n\\n*   You have a table named `order_items`.\\n*   The `order_items` table has columns named `product_id`, `price`, and `quantity`.\\n*   The `price` and `quantity` columns are numeric data types (e.g., INT, DECIMAL, FLOAT).\\n\\n---\\n\\nDo you want me to:\\n\\n*   Explain how this query relates to a specific database schema?\\n*   Provide an example of the data in the `order_items` table?\\n*   Help you modify this query to include additional filters or calculations (e.g., only sales from a specific date range)?\"}"
